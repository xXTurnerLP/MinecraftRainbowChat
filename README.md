# Requirements
You must be on any 1.16 version!
You  require to be **op** and either have the *server console* or the server has to have *enabled command blocks* because the commands can be very long and the chat box will not be enough :)

# Tutorial
1. Open the program <br>
1. Type your in-game username and hit *enter* (spaces are ignored so you can have as many as you want, they will be stripped out, as well as every character after the 32th) <br>
1. Type the message you want to type and hit *enter* (For now only ASCII is supported, so Cyrilic, Chinese and special symbols **will not** work!) <br>
1. And you are <ins>done</ins>! The command will be *automatically* copied to your clipboard so you just have to press **Ctrl+V** in minecraft console or command block. If the command is not copied (example: you dont have enough memory) the command will be written out in the console) <br>

# Download
You can download the program in the [Releases](https://github.com/xXTurnerLP/MinecraftRainbowChat/releases/) section
